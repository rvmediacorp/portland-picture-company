    content: "Living in the Pacific Northwest means rain is inevitable, especially during portrait season. But here's a secret: some of our most stunning photos happen on overcast, drizzly days.\n\nOvercast skies act like a giant softbox, diffusing harsh sunlight and creating even, flattering light on faces. No squinting, no harsh shadows—just soft, dreamy illumination that makes skin glow.\n\nLight rain adds atmosphere and mood to your photos. Wet pavement reflects light beautifully, creating mirror-like surfaces. Raindrops on leaves and grass add texture and interest. And there's something romantic about couples huddled under an umbrella or families splashing in puddles.\n\nSo next time the forecast calls for rain, don't panic. Embrace it! Bring colorful umbrellas, wear boots you don't mind getting muddy, and trust that we'll create something magical together."

    content: "Fall is hands-down the best season for family photos in the Pacific Northwest. The colors, the light, the cozy vibes—it all comes together beautifully. But what should you actually wear?\n\n**Color Palette:** Think warm, earthy tones. Rust, mustard, olive green, cream, and burgundy all photograph beautifully against fall foliage. Avoid bright neons or all-black outfits, which can look harsh.\n\n**Layers and Textures:** This is where fall really shines. Chunky knit sweaters, denim jackets, scarves, and boots add visual interest and dimension to photos. Mix textures—pair a cable-knit sweater with a leather jacket, or a flowy dress with a structured coat.\n\n**Coordination, Not Matching:** Your family doesn't need to wear identical outfits. Instead, choose a color palette and let everyone pick pieces they feel comfortable in. Aim for a cohesive look rather than matchy-matchy.\n\n**Comfort is Key:** You'll be moving around, sitting on the ground, and possibly getting a little muddy. Choose clothes that fit well and that you can move in. If you're not comfortable, it'll show in the photos."

We met at Trillium Lake just before sunset, and the light did not disappoint.\n\nThe kids immediately ran to the water's edge, skipping rocks and exploring. Rather than forcing poses, we let them play while we captured genuine moments of joy and connection. Mom and Dad joined in, and soon everyone was laughing and splashing.\n\nAs the sun dipped behind the mountain, the light turned golden and warm. We moved to a nearby meadow where the grasses glowed in the evening light. The family walked hand-in-hand, swung the kids between them, and just enjoyed being together.\n\nThese are the moments that matter—not perfect poses, but real connection. The Thompsons left with muddy shoes, tired kids, and a gallery full of images that truly capture who they are as a family.\n\nIf you're considering a mountain session, don't hesitate. The drive is worth it, and the memories you'll create are priceless."

Here's how to get headshots that look polished and approachable.\n\n**1. Choose the Right Outfit:** Stick with solid colors that complement your skin tone. Avoid busy patterns or logos. A blazer or button-down shirt works well, but don't be afraid to show personality with a pop of color.\n\n**2. Think About Your Expression:** Practice your smile in the mirror before the session. A genuine smile reaches your eyes—think about something that makes you happy, not just 'say cheese.'\n\n**3. Posture Matters:** Stand or sit up straight, but keep your shoulders relaxed. Slightly angle your body rather than facing the camera head-on for a more flattering look.\n\n**4. Natural Light is Your Friend:** We shoot headshots using natural light whenever possible. It's softer and more flattering than harsh studio lighting.\n\n**5. Relax and Trust the Process:** The best headshots happen when you're relaxed and comfortable. We'll chat, laugh, and take plenty of shots so you have options to choose from."

Emma's mom helped her into her dress while her bridesmaids popped champagne. Meanwhile, Jake and his groomsmen were cracking jokes and tying bow ties in the groom's room.\n\nThe ceremony took place in the venue's garden, surrounded by towering evergreens and string lights. As Emma walked down the aisle, Jake's eyes welled up—a moment I was honored to capture.\n\nAfter the ceremony, we snuck away for couples portraits in the nearby forest. The light filtering through the trees was magical, and Emma and Jake were so natural together. They laughed, kissed, and just enjoyed being newlyweds.\n\nThe reception was a dance party from start to finish. Toasts brought tears and laughter, the first dance was swoon-worthy, and the dance floor stayed packed all night.\n\nThis is why I love photographing weddings—every single one is unique, and every couple has their own story to tell."

Your photos should reflect this.\n\n**Create a Shot List:** Make a list of the types of images you need—headshots, workspace shots, product photos, lifestyle images. Think about where you'll use these photos (website, social media, marketing materials) and plan accordingly.\n\n**Wardrobe Planning:** Bring 3-5 outfit options that align with your brand. Solid colors photograph best, and you'll want variety for different uses. Don't forget accessories!\n\n**Prep Your Space:** If we're shooting at your office or workspace, tidy up and add personal touches that reflect your brand. Plants, books, and meaningful objects add character.\n\n**Relax and Be Yourself:** The best branding photos show the real you. Don't try to be someone you're not—your ideal clients want to work with the authentic you."

The colorful book spines make for vibrant, unique photos.\n\n**The Pearl District:** Cobblestone streets, brick buildings, and modern architecture create an urban vibe that's perfect for stylish couples.\n\n**Mt. Tabor:** This extinct volcano offers panoramic city views, especially beautiful at golden hour. The reservoir and surrounding park provide variety in one location.\n\n**Pittock Mansion:** The mansion grounds offer stunning views of downtown Portland and Mt. Hood.

But after years of photographing families, I've learned a few tricks.\n\n**Timing is Everything:** Schedule your session when kids are typically happy and well-rested. Avoid nap time, meal time, or the end of a long day.\n\n**Bring Snacks:** Hungry kids are grumpy kids. Pack some non-messy snacks and water to keep energy levels up.\n\n**Let Them Play:** The best photos happen when kids are just being kids. We'll incorporate games, running, jumping, and exploring into the session.\n\n**Keep It Short:** Little ones have short attention spans. We'll work efficiently and keep the session moving so kids don't get bored.\n\n**Bribe Strategically:** Sometimes a promise of ice cream after photos works wonders. No shame in that game.\n\n**Lower Your Expectations:** Not every kid will smile at the camera, and that's okay. Some of the best photos are the candid, in-between moments.\n\n**Trust the Process:** I've photographed hundreds of families with young kids. Even if it feels chaotic in the moment, I promise we'll get beautiful photos."

If you need images for a website, social media, and print materials, you'll want a package with more variety.\n\n**Budget Realistically:** Photography is an investment. While it's tempting to go with the cheapest option, remember that you're paying for expertise, equipment, editing time, and years of experience.\n\n**Ask About What's Included:** Does the package include digital files? Prints? How many edited images will you receive? What's the turnaround time?\n\n**Room to Grow:** If you're unsure, it's often better to start with a smaller package and add on if needed. Most photographers offer à la carte options.\n\n**Trust Your Gut:** Beyond the package details, make sure you connect with your photographer.

We also have backup equipment in case something fails.\n\n**Editing Skills:** The magic doesn't stop when the shutter clicks. Professional editing brings out the best in every image—adjusting exposure, color, and retouching while maintaining a natural look.\n\n**You're in the Photo:** When you hire a photographer, you get to be in the pictures. No more mom or dad behind the camera missing out on family photos.\n\n**Preserving Memories:** Life moves fast. Professional photos freeze moments in time—your kids at this exact age, your business at this stage, your love on your wedding day. These images become more valuable as time passes.\n\n**For Business:** Professional photos elevate your brand and help you stand out. They show potential clients that you take your business seriously.\n\nPhotography is an investment in memories, in your brand, in your story. And that's priceless."
